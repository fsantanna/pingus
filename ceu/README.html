<p>Let's consider the case of handling double clicks in the game.</p>
<p>In Pingus, double clicking the <em>Armageddon button</em> literally explodes all pingus, as illustrated in the figure in the right.</p>
<p>The code in C++ [<a href="https://github.com/Pingus/pingus/blob/v0.7.6/src/pingus/components/action_button.cpp">X</a>] implements the class <code>ArmageddonButton</code> with methods for rendering and handling events. Here, we focus on detecting the double click, hiding unrelated parts:</p>
<pre><code>ArmageddonButton::ArmageddonButton(&lt;...&gt;):
    RectComponent(&lt;...&gt;),
    &lt;...&gt;
    pressed(false);                         // line X1
    press_time();                           // line X3
    &lt;...&gt;
{
    &lt;...&gt;
}

void ArmageddonButton::draw (&lt;...&gt;) {       // X10
    &lt;...&gt;
}                                           // X11

void ArmageddonButton::update (float delta) {
    &lt;...&gt;
    if (pressed) {                          // line X9
        press_time += delta;                // line X4
        if (press_time &gt; 1.0f) {
            pressed = false;                // line X5
            press_time = 0;                 // line X6
        }
    } else {
        pressed = false;
        press_time = 0;
    }
}

void ArmageddonButton::on_primary_button_click (&lt;...&gt;) {
    if (pressed) {                          // line X8
        server-&gt;send_armageddon_event();    // line X7
    } else {
        pressed = true;                     // line X2
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The class first initializes the variable <code>pressed</code> to track the first click (ln. X1,X2). It also initializes the variable <code>press_time</code> to count the time since the first click (ln. X3,X4). If another click occurs within 1 second, the class signals the double click to the application (ln. X7). Otherwise, the <code>pressed</code> and <code>press_time</code> state variables are reset (ln. X5-X6).</p>
<p>The methods <code>update</code> and <code>on_primary_button_click</code> are examples of <em>short-lived callbacks</em>, which are pieces of code that execute in reaction to external input events. Here, <code>on_primary_button_click</code> reacts to mouse clicks, while <code>update</code> continuously reacts to the passage of time. Callbacks are short lived because they must execute as fast as possible to keep the game with real-time responsiveness. Because callbacks are short lived, the only way they can affect each other is by manipulating persisting member variables in the object. These <em>state variables</em> retain their values across multiple invocations, e.g.: <code>on_primary_button_click</code> writes to <code>pressed</code> in the first click, and checks its state in further clicks (ln. X2,X8), In the meantime, <code>update</code> also checks for <code>pressed</code> and may change its state (ln. X9,X5).</p>
<p>However, note how the accesses to these state variables are spread across the entire class. For instance, the distance between the initialization of <code>pressed</code> (ln. X1) and the last access to it (ln. X2) is over 40 lines in the original file [<a href="https://github.com/Pingus/pingus/blob/v0.7.6/src/pingus/components/action_button.cpp#L33-#L90">X</a>]. Arguably, this dispersion of code across methods makes the understanding and maintenance of the double-click behavior more difficult. Also, even though the state variables are private, unrelated methods such as <code>draw</code> (ln. X10-X11) can potentially access it.</p>
<p>Céu provides structured constructs to deal with events, aiming to eradicate explicit manipulation of state variables for control-flow purposes. The equivalent code in Céu [<a href="https://github.com/fsantanna/pingus/blob/ceu/ceu/pingus/components/action_button.ceu">X</a>] defines the class <code>ArmageddonButton</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>class ArmageddonButton with
    &lt;...&gt;
do                                                      // X9
    var RectComponent component = &lt;...&gt;;
    &lt;...&gt;
    loop do                                             // line X1
        await component.on_primary_button_click;        // line X3
        watching 1s do                                  // line X4
            await component.on_primary_button_click;    // line X6
            break;                                      // line X7
        end                                             // line X5
    end                                                 // line X2
    &lt;...&gt;
    emit global:go_armageddon;                          // line X8
end                                                     // X10</code></pre>
<p>Instead of <em>objects</em>, classes in Céu specify <em>organisms</em> with a body declaration (ln. X9-X10) which executes for each instance while alive. Unlike objects, an organism is an active entity and starts to execute its body in a concurrent and deterministic manner with other alive organisms (but <em>not</em> actually in parallel). An execution body can use control-flow statements that keep the execution context across event occurrences (i.e., across <code>await</code> statements).</p>
<p>The double click detection is a <code>loop</code> (ln. X1-X2) that awaits the first click (ln. X3) and then, watching 1 second (ln. X4-X5), awaits the second click (ln X6). If the second click occurs within 1 second, we <code>break</code> the loop (ln. X7) and signal the double click to the application (ln X8). Otherwise, the <code>watching</code> block as a whole aborts and restarts the loop, falling back to the first click <code>await</code> (ln X3).</p>
<p>The double click detection in Céu doesn't require state variables and is entirely self-contained in the <code>loop</code> body (ln. X1-X2). Furthermore, these 7 lines of code do nothing besides detecting a double click, i.e., the actual effect happens outside the loop (ln. X8).</p>
<p>As we argue throughout the document, appropriate control-flow mechanisms (e.g., <code>await</code> and <code>watching</code>) helps on the structure and composition of code, leading to considerable gains in productivity.</p>
<h1 id="why-porting-pingus-to-céu">Why porting Pingus to Céu?</h1>
<p>The main motivation to port Pingus from C++ to Céu is to promote its programming model in the context of video games. Céu supports concurrent and deterministic abstractions to specify entities with a high degree of real-time interactions, such as in video game simulation.</p>
<p><img src="images/sweeney.png" width="350" align="right" valign="top"/></p>
<p>According to Tim Sweeney (of Unreal Engine fame), about half of the development complexity resides in the <em>game simulation</em> code [<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/popl/06/Tim-POPL.ppt">X</a>]. If we consider that <em>numeric computation</em> and <em>shading</em> do not vary from game to game (i.e., they are part of a game engine), the tendency is to shift the complexity even more towards game simulation. Furthermore, only 10% of the CPU budget goes to game simulation, opening an opportunity for gains in productivity.</p>
<!--
When updating 10,000 objects at 60 FPS, everything is performance-sensitive
But:
Productivity is just as important
Will gladly sacrifice 10% of our performance
for 10% higher productivity
We never use assembly language

Gameplay Simulation
Gratuitous use of mutable state
10,000’s of objects must be updated
Typical object update touches 5-10 other objects

This is the hardest problem…
10,00’s of objects
Each one contains mutable state
Each one updated 30 times per second
Each update touches 5-10 other objects
 
Manual synchronization (shared state concurrency) is 
hopelessly intractible here.
 
Solutions?
Rewrite as referentially-transparent functions?
Message-passing concurrency?
Continue using the sequential, single-threaded approach?

Update all objects concurrently in arbitrary order, with each update wrapped in 
an atomic {...} block.
With 10,000’s of updates, and 5-10 objects touched per update, collisions will 
be low.
~2-4X STM performance overhead is acceptable:
if it enables our state-intensive code to scale to many threads, it’s still a win

Claim: Transactions are the only plausible solution to concurrent mutable state
-->

<p>Besides promoting the concurrency model of Céu, we enumerate additional motivations for this report as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expose Céu to a real code base that was neither specified nor implemented by the designers of language. Even though video games match its domain, Céu is still primarily an academic &quot;toy&quot; language. Also, a real-world project consists of a range of requirements, forcing us to transpose the &quot;academic fences&quot; of papers, which usually only explore idiomatic code.</li>
<li>Exercise the interface between Céu and C/C++. Céu is designed to integrate seamlessly with C. This allowed us to perform a <em>live porting</em>, i.e., we incrementally ported code from C++ to Céu without breaking the game for long.</li>
<li>Serve as a deep and comprehensive guide for developers interested in trying Céu. We discuss a number of game behaviors with an in-depth comparison between the original code in C++ and the equivalent code ported to Céu.</li>
<li>Stress-test the implementation of Céu. Academic artifacts typically do not go beyond working prototypes. We also want Céu to be a robust and practical language for everyday use.</li>
<li>Evaluate the performance of Céu. Having C++ as a benchmark, how does Céu compare in terms of memory usage, code size, and execution time (e.g., FPS rate)?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-port">How to port?</h1>
<p>The general idea is to identify control-flow patterns that encompass successive reactions to events, which imply crossing multiple method invocations in C++. We then rewrite these patterns in a class in Céu, using appropriate structured constructs, and redirect the instantiation and event dispatching to the new class. The remaining classes in C++ should interoperate with the new classes in Céu until we complete the porting process.</p>
<p>Note that we only touch classes that deal with events, as Céu is actually less expressive than C++ for pure data manipulation. Hence, we rely on the integration between Céu and C/C++ and take advantage of the existing code base and libraries.</p>
<p>To identify these control-flow patterns, we inspect the C++ class definitions searching for members with suspicious names (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/Pingus/pingus/blob/v0.7.6/src/pingus/components/action_button.hpp#L36"><code>pressed</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/Pingus/pingus/blob/v0.7.6/src/pingus/actions/bomber.hpp#L31"><code>particle_thrown</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/Pingus/pingus/blob/v0.7.6/src/pingus/actions/bridger.hpp#L30"><code>mode</code></a>, or <a href="https://github.com/Pingus/pingus/blob/v0.7.6/src/pingus/actions/digger.hpp#L32"><code>delay_count</code></a>). Good chances are that variables with identifiers resembling verbs, status, or counters encode some form of control-flow progression that cross multiple callback invocations.</p>
<p>We believe that most difficulties in implementing control behavior in games is not inherent to this domain, but the result of accidental complexity due to the lack of structured abstractions and appropriate concurrency models to handle event-based applications.</p>
<p>During the course of the porting process, and following the class-by-class identification described above, we could extract more abstract control patterns that should apply to other games. Our hypothesis is that other games manifesting such patterns must use some form of explicit state which are likely subject to the same porting process.</p>
<h2 id="control-flow-patterns-in-pingus">Control-Flow Patterns in Pingus</h2>
<p>We identified seven evident control-flow patterns in Pingus which we discuss further with in-depth examples:</p>

3. **Continuation Passing**
    The completion of long-lasting activity in a game may have a continuation, 
    i.e., some action to execute next.

    If the execution flow is dynamic, the program has to tell the activity 
    where to go when it completes.
    In Pingus, when the player terminates a level, the game may terminate or
    return to the main menu, depending on how it was invoked from the command
    line.

4. **Signaling Mechanisms**
    Entities often need to communicate explicitly through a signaling 
    mechanism, especially if there is no hierarchy relationship between them.

    As illustrated in the figure in the right, the clicking the checkbox 
    toggles the *Mouse Grab* flag.
    However, at any point in the game (even outside the *Option Menu*), 
    pressing *Ctrl-G* also toggles the same flag, which should adjust the
    checkbox accordingly.

5. **Wall-Clock Timers**
    Wall-clock timers measure the passage of time from the real world
    (e.g., *10 seconds*) such as for periodic sampling and timeout watchdogs.

    The double click behavior above uses a timeout of 1 second to restart.

6. **Pausing**
    Pausing allows parts of the game to temporarily suspend execution or
    reactions to incoming events.

    In Pingus, the player can press a button in the screen to toggle between 
    pause and resume.

7. **Resource Acquisition and Release**
    External resources, such as configuration files and saved games,
    must be acquired and properly released.

<pre><code>Bomber::Bomber (Pingu* p) :

    // 2. 10th frame: plays a &quot;Bomb!&quot; sound.

    if (sprite.is_finished ()) {                                        // X12
        pingu-&gt;set_status(Pingu::PS_DEAD);                              // X13
    }
}

void Bomber::draw (SceneContext&amp; gc) {
    // 3. 13th frame: throws particles, destroys the terrain, shows an explosion sprite

        gc.color().draw (explo_surf, &lt;...&gt;);                            // X11
    }
    gc.color().draw(sprite, pingu-&gt;get_pos ());
}</code></pre>
<p>The class defines one state variable for each action to perform (ln. X1-X2). The &quot;Oh no!&quot; sound plays as soon as the object starts in <em>state-1</em> (ln. X3). The <code>update</code> callbacks update the animation sprite and moves the pingu every frame (ln. X4-X4.1), regardless of the current state. When the animation reaches the 10th frame, it plays the &quot;Bomb!&quot; if it hasn't yet (ln. X5-X6), going to <em>state-2</em>. The <code>sound_played</code> state variable is required because the sprite frame doesn't necessarily advance on every <code>update</code> invocation. The same reasoning and technique applies to the <em>state-3</em> (ln. X7-X8 and X9-X10). The explosion sprite appears in a single frame in <em>state-4</em> (ln. X11). Finally, the pingu dies after the animation frames terminate (ln. X12-X13).</p>
<p>Note that a single numeric state variable would suffice to track the states. Probably, the authors chose to encode each state in an independent boolean variable to rearrange and experiment with them during the development.</p>
<p>However, due to the short-lived nature of callbacks, state variables are unavoidable, being part of the essence of object-oriented programming (methods + mutable state).</p>

<p>The implementation in Céu doesn't require explicit state variables and more closely reflects in the source code the sequential state machine:</p>

<p>Considering the implementation in Céu, we can highlight some benefits in comparison to the implementation in C++:</p>
<ul>
<li>We encode all states implicitly, relying on the natural sequential flow of execution.</li>
<li>We handle all states (and only them) in the same contiguous block of code.</li>
<li>We isolate unrelated behaviors to the animation, such as the pingu movement (ln. X1), in a parallel line of execution.</li>
<li>We use a local and lexically-scoped organism (to be discussed [X][hierarchical-dispatching]) for the temporary single-frame explosion (ln. X4-X5).</li>
<li>We use auxiliary signalling mechanisms (to be discussed [X][signalling-mechanisms]) to await the termination of the animation (ln. X2) and to notify the application about our own termination.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dispatching-hierarchies">Dispatching Hierarchies</h3>
<p>Some entities in games act as containers for other child entities, resulting in dispatching hierarchies for event handling. <!--
    In Pingus, the *Main Menu* in the figure above is represented as a 
    container class with five buttons as children.
    When a button click occurs, it is first dispatched to the container class,
    which may take an action before deciding to forward the event (or not) to 
    the buttons.

<h5 id="c-1">C++</h5>
<p>Let's dig into the <code>Bomber</code> animation in C++ [<a href="https://github.com/Pingus/pingus/blob/v0.7.6/src/pingus/actions/bomber.cpp">X</a>], focusing on the <code>sprite</code> member, and the <code>update</code> and <code>draw</code> callback methods:</p>
<pre><code>// bomber.hpp/cpp

class Bomber : public PinguAction
{
    &lt;...&gt;
    Sprite sprite;
    void draw (SceneContext&amp; gc);
    void update();
}

<p>The class loads the <code>sprite</code> in the constructor (ln. X1) and continually redirects <code>update</code> and <code>draw</code> to it (ln. X2-X3 and X4-X5). The <code>Sprite</code> class [[X][cpp-sprite]] knows how to update [[X][cpp-sprite-update]] and render [[X][cpp-sprite-render]] itself.</p>
<p>However, we have to follow a long hierarchy of 8 dispatches to understand how the <code>update</code> and <code>draw</code> callbacks flow from the original stimulus from the environment down to the sprite:</p>

</ol>
<p>Each dispatching level of indirection has a reason to exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a single assignment to <code>last_screen</code>, we can easily redirect all dispatches to a new screen.</li>
<li>The <code>gui_manager</code> manages and dispatches events to all screen components with a common interface.</li>
<li>The <code>World</code> groups only the actual concrete and recognizable game entities loaded dynamically from an external level file (e.g., all pingus and traps).</li>
<li>As it is common to iterate only over the pingus (vs. all world objects), it is convenient to manage all pingus in a <code>PinguHolder</code>.</li>
<li>As pingus change between actions during lifetime, decoupling them from actions with a level of indirection is also convenient.</li>
<li>Sprites are reusable everywhere, so it is also convenient to decouple them from actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this dispatching architecture comes at a high price:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reasoning about the dispatching rules requires inspecting dozen of files (we omitted class hierarchies in the list above).</li>
<li>The dispatching path interleaves between classes specific to the game and classes from the game engine (possibly third-party classes), making the reasoning even harder.</li>
<li>The hierarchy is mostly dynamic, specially for entities held in containers.</li>
</ul>
<!--* TODO: efficiency?-->

<p>Generic containers demand extra caution when they handle insertion and removal of components dynamically (which is usually the case):</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking what entities gets dispatched is difficult: one has to &quot;simulate&quot; the program execution and track calls to <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/game-session-arrows.png" width="300" align="right" valign="top"/></p>
<p>Furthermore, it is actually common to have children with a static lifespan known at compile time. For instance, most entities in the <code>GameSession</code> coexists with it, i.e., they are added in the constructor and are never removed explicitly [<a href="https://github.com/Pingus/pingus/blob/v0.7.6/src/pingus/screens/game_session.cpp#L76">X</a>]:</p>
<pre><code>GameSession::GameSession(&lt;...&gt;) :
    &lt;...&gt;
{
    &lt;...&gt;
    button_panel = new ButtonPanel(&lt;...&gt;);      // always active...
    pcounter     = new PingusCounter(&lt;...&gt;);
    small_map    = new SmallMap(&lt;...&gt;);
    &lt;...&gt;
    gui_manager-&gt;add(button_panel);             // ...but added dynamically
    gui_manager-&gt;add(pcounter);
    gui_manager-&gt;add(small_map);
    &lt;...&gt;
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Calls to <code>add</code> must always have matching calls to <code>remove</code>: missing calls to <code>remove</code> lead to memory and CPU leaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, pingus are dynamic entities created periodically and destroyed under certain conditions (e.g. when going out of the screen [<a href="https://github.com/Pingus/pingus/blob/v0.7.6/src/pingus/pingu.cpp#L322">X</a>]). <code>PinguHolder::update</code> checks all pingus every frame, removing those with the <code>Pingu::PS_DEAD</code> status (ln. X1-X2):</p>
<p>TODO: falling image</p>
<pre><code>void PinguHolder::update() {
    &lt;...&gt;
    while(pingu != pingus.end()) {
        (*pingu)-&gt;update();
        if ((*pingu)-&gt;get_status() == Pingu::PS_DEAD) { // X1
            pingu = pingus.erase(pingu);
        }                                               // X2
        &lt;...&gt;
        ++pingu;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Without the <code>erase</code> call, a dead pingu would keep consuming memory and CPU time, i.e., it would remain in the <code>pingus</code> vector and be updated every frame (ln. X3).</p>
<p>This problem is known as the <em>lapsed listener</em> [<a href="https://github.com/Pingus/pingus/blob/v0.7.6/src/pingus/pingu.cpp#L322">X</a>]) and is not restricted to languages without garbage collection. Typically, a container holds a strong reference to a child (sometimes the only reference to it), and a collector cannot magically detect it as garbage.</p>
<h5 id="céu-1">Céu</h5>
<p>As mentioned before, organisms in Céu are active entities and can react directly to the environment. For instance, the <code>Sprite</code> instance held by the <code>Bomber</code> [<a href="https://github.com/fsantanna/pingus/blob/ceu/ceu/pingus/actions/bomber.ceu#L17">X</a>] bypasses the program hierarchy and reacts directly to the external event <code>WORLD_UPDATE</code> [<a href="https://github.com/fsantanna/pingus/blob/ceu/ceu/engine/display/sprite.ceu#L109">X</a>].</p>
<p>On the one hand, this radical decoupling between the program hierarchy and external reactions completely eliminates dispatch forwarding. For instance, we removed from the engine most of the boilerplate related to dispatching <code>draw</code>, <code>update</code>, and other callbacks ([X][TODO]). On the other hand, now that the organism itself decides whether or not to react to input, we need some other external mechanism to control its life cycle.</p>

## The Game Loop

The *game loop* determines the general structure of virtually all games 
&#91;[X][gpp-gameloop]&#93; (Pingus is no different &#91;[X][pingus-gameloop]&#93;):

```
while (true)
{
    processInput();
    update();
    render();
}
```

> A game loop runs continuously during gameplay.
> Each turn of the loop, it processes user input without blocking, updates the 
> game state, and renders the game.
> It tracks the passage of time to control the rate of gameplay.

The `update` function does the hard work, dealing with the state of all game 
entities, and has to execute as fast as possible to keep real-time 
responsiveness to input events.
However, short-lived functions such as `update` do not retain local variables 
and control-flow state across consecutive invocations.
In this sense, they eliminate any vestige of structured programming, becoming 
*our generation's goto* &#91;[X][goto]&#93;.

## The Synchronous Concurrency Model

```
    initialize state;
    while (true) do
        read inputs;
        update state;
        write outputs;
    end
```

The game loop:
`ScreenManager::display`
https://github.com/fsantanna/pingus/blob/master/src/engine/screen/screen_manager.cpp#L164

```
void ScreenManager::display() {
    Uint32 old = SDL_GetTicks();

    while (!screens.empty()) {
        // READ INPUTS
        Uint32 now = SDL_GetTicks();
        Uint32 delta = now - old;
        old = now;
        <read-other-inputs>

        // UPDATE STATE
        screens.back()->update(delta);
        <update-other-inputs>

        // WRITE OUTPUTS
        screens.back()->draw(<...>);
        Display::flip_display();
    }
}
```

## Céu

<!-
- control
    = Accidental complexity
- not pure functions

- end of document
    - GC, why gcc doesn't solve: lapsed listeners
        - static mem, orgs, aliases, lexical scope
    - GC also doesn't solve resources:
Garbage collecting resources (file handles, etc):

This is a very different question, because resource freeing has observable 
consequences beyond performance and memory consumption - unlike garbage 
collection, which is justified by the realization that if you don't have any 
pointers to a value in memory, then it can simply dissapear (or not) without 
observable consequences.

For example, if you have a file handle open for writing, then other applications can't open that file. You want such resource usage to be clear and deterministic, so that files don't just remain open for a random duration depending on the garbage collector's internals.

In general, I would not advocate garbage collection of OS resources or any other thing requiring explicit cleanup. For example, I think that Java/C# finalizers are a misguided idea, because they have observable, nondeterministic consequences. That is exactly the sort of feature a high-level, secure language should avoid. The bizarre finalization state diagrams for those languages should be enough to indicate that something is wrong here!

For resource freeing, constructs which guarantee that every resource is freed look promising (think of wrapping a file handle in an abstraction like a Haskell State monad). Or just plain old handles with explicit closing (and thus the risk of not closing a handle, closing it when it's not open, etc).

Garbage collection without type information?

C++ garbage collection would greatly benefit if it was assisted by the compiler. During a scan, only pointers to objects need to be scanned. Unfortunately, it is not possible without assistance from the compiler. That is the reason third-party solutions are not good enough for performance-intensive applications.

Memory management and resource management is not the same. Resources other than memory are usually few in a program and not interconnected. A program may have files, sockets, windows and other types of handles, but usually these handles are 'dead ends', i.e. they do not contain references to other handles. Memory, on the other hand, is a totally different beast: a block of memory usually contains references to other blocks of memory. So the idea of finalizers is a bad one, since resources other than memory should be freed by RAII techniques (for deterministic resource management), but memory should be handled by garbage collector.

I will say it again, because no one seemed to notice it: could it be that there exists a "calculus" for resource management?

## Idioms

<!-
All patterns relate to event handling and control flow in games, and we argue 
how Céu offers more appropriate abstractions than existing languages.

### State Machines

    At any time, the program can only be in a single state, which globally and 
    univocally represents the current XXX.
    This unique and global view of the program state as a single value has 
maintenance scalability problems (AKA the *state explosion phenomena*).
    - state machines vs await
    The more XXX, the more states to track, state explosion.
    The machine transits from state to state

, as we encode the fact

 It can change from one state to another when initiated by a triggering event 
or condition; this is called a transition.
    - state machines vs await

Map the whole behavior into a single number is a problem.
    - hierarchical machines can help, but still has this mapping property
        - locally unscallabe
        - still a data sultion to a control problem
        - explicit state machines vs implicit
        - incremental implementation requires global changes
            - in ceu, its just compositions

### Hierarchies

    - class hierarchies/dispatching vs await
    - difficult to track origin
        - has to traverse the whole hierarchy
    - used in pause
    - not class hier
    - flat dispatching (diagrama mostrando os dois)

 (e.g., a key press or expiring timer)
    - class hierarchies/dispatching vs await
    - lexical scope
    - visitor pattern

    - new /delete

### Continuations

    - CPS vs return continue
        - screen trasnitions
        - story screen advancing
        - story screen -> credits screen
        - WM pingu path traversal
        - worse w/o closures
    Typically, screen transitions are not static

### Signaling Between Entities

    - signaling/f pointer vs events
        - option save on click
        - global events double direction
            - key/mouse-but events
                - sendo que but tem que ficar highlight ou nao
        - verificar caso do option_menu
            - configuracao pode ser alterada por fora?
        - worse w/o closures

### Wall-Clock Timers
    - wall-clock time
        - story chars
        - credits up
        - fps
Activities that involve reactions to \emph{wall-clock time}%
\footnote{
By wall-clock time we mean the passage of time from the real world, measured in 
hours, minutes, etc.
}
appear in typical patterns of embedded development, such as timeout watchdogs 
and sensor samplings.
However, support for wall-clock time is somewhat low-level in existing 
languages, usually through timer callbacks or ``sleep'' blocking calls.

### Pausing
    - pause
        - alternative is again hierarchies which enable/disable forwarding
    - problem with timer callbacks

## The Code Base

Pingus has a code base around 40k lines of code (LoC):

    > cd pingus/src/
    > sloccount .
    ...

The code base includes a game engine, utilities, level editor, platform stubs, 
and the game logic.
Most of the porting process centered around the `engine` and `pingus` 
directory, as we did not port the level editor:
